description: "The São Pedro Mártir de Verona Parish covers a large riverside area where the favelas of Santa Cruz dos Milagres are located, as well as the Ilha do Maruim community formed by low-income residents. With ANSA's donation, they purchased construction materials and completed the construction of the community parish hall. The hall is used for professional training (painting classes, crafts, vocals, tutoring, hygiene classes, as well as religious, civic and moral catechism). It's known that access to a cultural space with its pedagogical activities helps prevent young people from getting involved in drugs and prostitution."
