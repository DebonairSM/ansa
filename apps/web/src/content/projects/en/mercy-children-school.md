The **Mercy Children School** (Instituto Misericordes Sicut Pater) is located in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul.

The school shelters **80 underprivileged children**, children of garbage collectors, offering academic activities and **3 meals a day**.

With ANSA's donation of **R$ 12,137 (US$ 2,960)**, cabinets and fans were purchased for three classrooms, the dining room, and the library.

This project demonstrates ANSA's commitment to the education and well-being of the most vulnerable children in our society.
