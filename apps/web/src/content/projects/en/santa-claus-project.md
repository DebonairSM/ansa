ANSA launched an **extraordinary project at Christmas 2020**! Sent Santa Claus to **150 children**, children of small farmers, sugarcane planters from Serra de Redenção, CE.

The region is affectionately called *Serrinha* and is beautiful, with lots of greenery and many flowers. The climate is very pleasant, which is conducive to sugarcane planting.

But there, Santa Claus wasn't going to visit. Well said, **"Wasn't going to"**, because through ANSA, he came and brought lots of joy and happiness to all the children of Serrinha.

Each child received gifts and treats, providing a special and memorable Christmas for families who often cannot afford to celebrate the date.
