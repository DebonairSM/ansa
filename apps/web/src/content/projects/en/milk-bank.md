The **Jesus Maria José Maternity Hospital** is located in Quixadá, Ceará, and received a donation from ANSA of **R$ 7,464 (US$ 2,000)** for the Milk Bank project.

With the donation received, the hospital purchased **essential equipment** for the project, including breastfeeding pumps and cabinets, in addition to covering a wall in the unit.

The donation was of great help, as the hospital will continue to provide assistance to underprivileged mothers in the region, who will be able to breastfeed their children so they can grow up healthy.
